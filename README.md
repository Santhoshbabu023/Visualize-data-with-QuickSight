# Visualize-data-with-QuickSight
Amazon QuickSight is a cloud-based BI service for analyzing, visualizing, and sharing insights from data. In this project, I used QuickSight to analyze a Netflix dataset stored in S3, created visualizations, applied filters, and explored trends. The dashboard was then shared and exported as a PDF for easy access.
